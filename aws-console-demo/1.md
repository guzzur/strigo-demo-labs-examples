## Interfaces

### AWS CLI

The AWS Command Line Interface (CLI) allows you to interact with AWS services using text commands. Let's verify that your AWS CLI is correctly configured.

[Go to your CLI interface]({{ .STRIGO_GOTO_LAB_0_INTERFACE_0 }})

```bash
aws sts get-caller-identity
```

### AWS Management Console

The AWS Management Console is the web-based interface where you can manage AWS services visually. Open the console and explore the available services.

[Go to your AWS Dashboard]({{ .STRIGO_GOTO_LAB_1 }})
