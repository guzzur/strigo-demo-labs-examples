# How will you practice?

An AWS cloud account has been provisioned for you.

You can interact with it in two different ways:

1. Via the CLI available in the lab's terminal.
1. Via the AWS console GUI available in the lab's dropdown.

## CLI access

Type the following commands in the terminal:

```
echo $AWS_ACCOUNT_ID
```

```
echo $AWS_ACCOUNT_NAME
```

## Check the resources in the AWS account

Try checking by running the following command in the terminal:

```
aws eks list-clusters --region us-east-2
```
